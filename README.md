# Machine-Learning-Based-Fake-News-Detection-System

PROJECT TITLE: 
Machine Learning-Based Fake News Detection System

PROBLEM STATEMENT: 
In todayâ€™s digital age, the rapid spread of misinformation and fake news across social media and online platforms has become a critical concern. The widespread dissemination of false information can lead to severe consequences, including public panic, political manipulation, and societal unrest. Traditional methods of identifying and combating fake news are often slow and inefficient, making it difficult to address this issue in real time. This project aims to develop a Machine Learning-Based Fake News Detection System that can automatically classify and filter out fake news from genuine news articles by analyzing textual content and patterns. By leveraging machine learning algorithms, this system will enhance the accuracy and efficiency of detecting misinformation, thereby contributing to a more informed and responsible digital environment.

DATASET INFORMATION: 
he dataset used for this project comprises various attributes, including the news headline, content, and the author who published it. It has been sourced from Kaggle, with full credit to the original creator and uploader. The dataset includes the following features:

'ID': Represents the sequential identifier for each news article. 'Title': Contains the news headline. 'Author': Lists the name(s) of the publisher(s). 'Text': Contains the main body of the news article. 'Label': Indicates whether the news is fake (denoted by 1) or real (denoted by 0).
